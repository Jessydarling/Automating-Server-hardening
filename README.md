For the CyberGirls 4.0 Open Day project (Group 3),


we focused on enhancing the security and performance of our Windows Server by integrating automation and following industry best practices. 
Leveraging PowerShell scripts, we automated essential security tasks, including firewall configuration, disabling redundant services, applying software updates, and enforcing security policies such as Windows Update, audit, account lockout, and strong password policies. 


This automation not only improved system security but also increased operational efficiency.
